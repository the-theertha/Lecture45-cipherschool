--BINARY TREE
A tree in which each node can have at max 2 children.

Proper Binary Tree :- Each node can have either 2 or no children.
Complete Binary Tree :- All levels, possibly except the last are completely filled and all nodes are as left as possible.
Perfect Binary Tree :- If all the levels are completely filled.
Balanced Binary Tree :- Difference between the height of left and right subtree for every node is not more than k(mostly k = 1).
